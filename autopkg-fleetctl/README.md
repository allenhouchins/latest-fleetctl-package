# Info
These are recipes that can be used with [AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg). You can also just download the latest `pkg` from https://github.com/allenhouchins/latest-fleetctl-package

Note: I originally created my own recipes in XML before being notified [jc0b had already created recipes](https://github.com/autopkg/jc0b-recipes). I have switched to using these exclusively. They are cleaner and easier to read. Plesae check out his repo!

## Dependencies:
`autopkg repo-add jazzace-recipes`

## Thank you!
Huge shoutout to [jc0b](https://github.com/jc0b) for creating these.
